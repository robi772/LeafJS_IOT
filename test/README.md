#Test program for L.TileLayer.Cordova
A simple test and demo, written for Cordova/Phonegap.
Load it into XCode or use "cordova run android" like any other Cordova application,
and try out the test buttons.

* Caching of offline tiles
* Switching to offline mode
* Zoom in and confirm that tiles still load if cached, and fail to load if not cached
* Optionally, test again in Airplane Mode just to be sure
